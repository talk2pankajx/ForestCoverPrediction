# Forest Cover Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict different forest cover types using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various environmental features that influence forest cover, and the model leverages these features to make accurate predictions.
it has been implemented with CI-CD pipelines, with github actions and self hosted runner


## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Structured file struture serves as a purpose of skeleton of any machine learning projects.

- Web application for prediction
- AWS integration for data storage and model deployment


## Architecture
Below are the architectural diagrams illustrating the system workflow:
